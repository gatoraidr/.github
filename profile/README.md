## Gatoraid: The Complete Saga

Gatoraid was a crappy, unfinished text dungeon project for the 2021 Game Off. Since then, I've been using the name Gatoraid to label every project that is focused on game development, because I love the name so much :)


The storyline in chronological order:
- Gatoraid
- Gatoraider: The Tale of the Cool Ranch Flavor
- Chomper: Game Engine (now defunct)
